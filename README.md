# readme

## hola! ðŸ‘‹

This readme is a introduction to who I am and things I care about, and a general guide to working with me. My hope is to be able to jumpstart our super fun working relationship, and minimise misunderstandings and tension.

Firstly, to get it out of the way, my name is pronounced "la-ren" ðŸ˜€

Disclaimer: this document will be constantly evolving, is probably not the most accurate, and potentially over-idealistic picture of myself, but it's a start. I don't know what it's like to work with me because I haven't worked with me, so I hope to find out from you, and make this readme more useful.

## why am I here?

I'm at WORK180 for two reasons:
1. the team is full of amazing humans who I love working with, and want to learn from
2. we get to build cool things that make the world better

Career goals:
1. become a decent engineer [based on something like the 1-(wo)man startup pattern](http://venturehacks.com/articles/1-wo-man-startups)
2. speak at lots of conferences, and publish some blogs
3. help get more women into tech

My goals are largely aimed at the far away (and always-moving) goal posts of starting my own company one day. I don't necessarily want to achieve that goal, but it helps to focus on what skills are needed to create successful products and teams. At the moment, my main focus is to learn the best engineering practices, to be able to ship a thing, and measure if people want the thing. My side interest is around management and leadership and building effective teams.

## schedule (or, lack there of)

My current life priorities are
1. exercise and health (what keeps me alive) - sleeping (sometimes), eating (always), and, now, bikes
2. social (what keeps me sane) - family and friends, and me time
3. having purpose/challenges (1. and 2. are prerequisites for this) - solving problems that help people (WORK180 fits in here)
4. giving back (an extension of 3.) - organising events and giving talks

I don't stick to any particular schedule or routine to achieve the above things, they happen when they happen depending on importance and urgency. [I loosely follow the Eisenhower Matrix when it comes to working out what I should be doing.](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/)

I've been known to look like I'm working 24/7, but I'm usually doing a mix of 2., 3., and 4. together which all happen on the laptop, so I will opportunistically respond to work things if I'm online.

I cohost two meetups in Brisbane, which are pretty low maintenance but will take up half a day sometimes. (I'm always looking for speakers!)
- Women Who Code (6pm, last Wednesday of every month)
- CTO School (6pm, first Wednesday of every month)

## comms

I read and respond to you at a time that works for me, I turn off my notifications when I don't want to receive them (I put my phone in do-not-disturb, or in another room). I will assume the same for you, unless we've talked about your specific working hours, and then I will as much as possible keep comms between those times.

Please don't feel like you shouldn't message me at 'odd' hours because you think I might feel pressured to read or respond, if I don't want to, I won't.

- If something is urgent - phone call
- If it's a difficult or crucial (e.g. feedback) conversation - my first preference is face-to-face, followed by video, followed by phone call
- If it's something you can wait an hour or on - private message or @mention in Slack
- If it's something you can wait a day or three on - email

Sometimes I can forget when you message me if I read it and got distracted by something else (and the notification disappears). Please don't think I'm ignoring you, I just forgot. Please ping me again.

If we decide on some actions or followups during our chats, I will likely write a message to you listing those action items, or create a calendar invite, because I don't trust my memory.

Always feel free to drop something in my calendar, don't worry too much about asking when I'm free, my calendar is usually up to date. I'll let you know if the time doesn't work.

## 1-on-1s and feedback

One-on-ones are extremely precious to me. They are like physio sessions for my personal growth - the more pain, the better.

I like to have them as often as possible. I like to have at least half a day to prepare for them, as well as an agenda if it helps make it easier to talk about the hard stuff.

The contents and goals of one-on-ones can change depending on who you are, and how we work together. As a baseline, I use one-on-ones as opportunities for feedback, both ways. They can involve food or beer (for the more casual catch-ups)

I try to give feedback as much I can, because it's something I want to get better at, and I want to help others achieve their goals.

I prefer feedback in-person or video call, but I don't mind if it's over the phone, Slack, or email - I love and appreciate all feedback. I don't mind how praise is given to me, publically or privately are both fine.

Don't wait for 1-on-1s if you want to talk to me about anything. Always happy to chat.

## about me

I'm passionate about accessibility, especially making the internet more accessible for people with low vision/blindness.

I was born in Melbourne, but I mostly grew up in a small town in south east Queensland called Hervey Bay. My mum is Taiwanese and my dad is Aussie, he's also mostly deaf and blind. I'm an only child. I moved to Brisbane when I was 16 to go to uni (and have had a few false-starts). I've moved back-and-forth between Melbourne and Queensland. I'm a dog person, but don't have a dog.

I used to play video games and drink beer and eat food. I used to draw a lot, I still carry around my sketchbook.

Now I ride bikes and drink beer and eat food.

I like listening podcasts and [audio books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25592324-larene), and I have terrible taste in music. I like playing tabletop games, but don't have as much time as I'd like to for it, my favourites are [Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)) (or Mafia/Werewolf) and [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)). I also enjoy pub trivia, but can only answer the science questions.

My coffee order is usually a latte, or tea milk and honey when I've had too much coffee.

## my quirks

I'm rarely emotional, usually I'm just hungry.

I sometimes blush a lot, it doesn't mean I'm embarrassed or hiding something or lying. Feel free to tease me about it.

If I find things hard to say in person for whatever reason (I couldn't phrase something the right way on-the-spot, or I wasn't able to think it through enough) I will type up my thoughts, and send them to you, usually in an overly verbose giant wall of text. Or I will ask to catch up later.

I don't deal well with indecision, if the group takes too long to decide on a thing, I will jump in and make a decision to get things moving.

I will always tell you if you have food in your teeth, I hope you'll do the same for me.

If you notice any other quirks, please tell me and I will list them here. I'm a pretty big weirdo sometimes.
