# readme

## hola! ðŸ‘‹

This readme is a introduction to who I am and things I care about, and a general guide to working with me. My hope is to be able to jumpstart our super fun working relationship, and minimise misunderstandings and tension.

Firstly, to get it out of the way, my name is pronounced "la-ren" ðŸ˜€

Disclaimer: this is version 1 of larene-readme and will probably change quite a lot over the next little bit, I don't know what it's like to work with me because I haven't worked with me, so I hope to find out from you, and be able to write it down here

## why am I here?

I'm at WORK180 for two reasons:
1. the team is full of amazing humans who I love working with, and want to learn from
2. we get to build things that make the world better, and have some fun along the way

Career goals:
1. Become a great engineer [based on something like the 1-woman startup pattern](http://venturehacks.com/articles/1-wo-man-startups)
2. Become an invited speaker to tech conferences, and publish some blogs
3. Inspire more women in tech

My career goals are largely aimed at the faraway (and always moving) goal-posts of starting my own startup one day. I don't necessarily want to achieve that goal at all, but it helps to focus on what skills are needed to create successful products and teams. At the moment, my main focus is to learn the best engineering practices to be able to ship a thing.

## schedule (or, lack there of)

Here are my current life priorities:
1. Exercise and health (what keeps me alive) -- sleeping (sometimes), eating (always), and now bikes
2. Social (what keeps me sane) -- family and friends
3. Having purpose / challenges (1. and 2. are prerequisites for this) -- solving problems that help people (WORK180 fits in here)
4. Giving back (an extension of 3.) -- organising events and giving talks

I don't stick to any particular schedule or routine to achieve the above things, they happen when they happen depending on importance and urgency. [I loosely follow the Eisenhower Matrix when it comes to working out what I should be doing.](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/)

I've been known to look like I'm working 24 hours a day, but I'm usually doing a mix of 3. and 4. together which all happen on the laptop, so I will opportunistically respond to things if I'm online.

I cohost two meetups in Brisbane
- Women Who Code (6pm, last Wednesday of every month)
- CTO School (6pm, first Wednesday of every month)

## comms

I read and respond to you at a time that works for me, I turn off my notifications when I don't want to receive them, and I will assume the same for you, unless we've talked about your specific working hours, and then I will as much as possible keep comms between those times.

Please don't feel like you can't message me at 'odd' hours because you think I might feel pressured to read or respond, if I don't want to, I won't.

If something is urgent -- phone call
If it's a difficult or crucial (e.g. feedback) conversation -- my first preference is face-to-face, followed by video, followed by phone call
If it's something you can wait an hour or on -- private message or @mention in Slack
If it's something you can wait a day or three on -- email

Sometimes I can forget when you message me if I read it and got distracted by something else (and the notification disappears). Please don't think I'm ignoring you, I just forgot. Please ping me again.

If we decide on some actions or followups during our chats, I will likely Slack a message to you listing those action items, or create a calendar invite, because I don't trust my memory.

Always feel free to drop something in my calendar, don't worry too much about asking when I'm free, my calendar is usually up to date.

## 1-on-1s and feedback

One-on-ones are extremely precious to me. They are like physio sessions for my personal growth -- the more pain, the better.

I like to have them as often as possible. I like to have at least half a day to prepare for them, and, sometimes, an agenda if it helps make it easier to talk about the hard stuff.

The contents and goals of one-on-ones can change depending on who you are and how we work together. As a baseline, I use one-on-ones as opportunities for feedback, both ways. They can involve food or beer (for more general catch-ups)

I try to give feedback as I can, because it's something I want to get better at, and I want to help others achieve their goals.

I prefer feedback in-person or video call, but I don't mind if it's over the phone, Slack, or email -- I love all feedback.

Don't wait for 1-on-1s if you want to talk to me about something. Always happy to chat.

## about me

I'm passionate about accessibility, especially making the internet more accessible for people with low vision/blindness.

I was born in Melbourne, but I mostly grew up in a small town in south east Queensland called Hervey Bay. My mum is Taiwanese and my dad is Aussie, he's also mostly deaf and blind. I'm an only child. I moved to Brisbane when I was 16 to go to uni (and have had a few false-starts). I've moved back-and-forth between Melbourne and Queensland. I'm a dog person, but don't have a dog.

I used to play video games and drink beer and eat food. I used to draw a lot, I still carry around my sketchbook, one day I want to publish a childrens book.

Now I ride bikes and drink beer and eat food.

I like listening podcasts and [audio books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25592324-larene), and I have terrible taste in music. I like playing tabletop games, but don't have as much time as I'd like to for it, my favourites are [Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game) (or Mafia/Werewolf) and [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)). I also enjoy pub trivia, but can only answer the science questions.

My coffee order is usually a latte, or tea milk and honey when I've had too much coffee.

## my quirks

I rarely get embarrassed, but I do blush a lot (physical response I can't seem to control).

If I find things hard to say in person for whatever reason (I can't phrase something the right way on-the-spot, or I wasn't prepared enough) I will type up my thoughts, and send them to you, usually in an overly verbose giant wall of text. Or I will ask to catch up later.

I don't deal well with indecision and wasting too much time going back-and-forth, I will jump in and make a decision (or pretend to) to get things moving.

I will always tell you if you have food in your teeth, I hope you'll do the same for me.

If you notice any others... please tell me and I will list them here.
